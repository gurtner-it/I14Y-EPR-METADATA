# I14Y EPR Metadata Management Toolkit

## 🎯 What This Does

This toolkit provides a complete workflow for managing healthcare code lists in the Swiss I14Y interoperability platform:

1. **Data Transformation** (`AD_I14Y_transformator.py`): Converts XML files into I14Y-compliant JSON structures (automatically creates both concepts and codelists)
2. **API Management** (`I14Y_API_handling.py`): Handles upload and management of concepts and code lists via I14Y REST API
3. **Registration Status Management**: Sets concepts to "Recorded" status
4. **Manual Platform Verification**: Final verification through I14Y web interface

## 📋 Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Transform XML to JSON (Creates Concepts & Codelists)
Transform XML files into I14Y-compatible JSON format. This step automatically generates both concept definitions and their associated code lists.

### Step 2: Upload New Concept Versions
Upload the transformed concept definitions to I14Y platform.

### Step 3: Upload Code Lists
Upload the code list entries to the previously created concepts.

### Step 4: Set Registration Status to "Recorded"
Update the concept registration status to make them officially recorded.

### Step 5: Manual Verification via I14Y GUI
Log into the I14Y web platform to verify the status and content of uploaded concepts.

# 🔄 Step-by-Step Workflow

## Workflow Overview

**Important:** Always test in ABN environment first (Steps 1-5), then deploy to PROD (repeat Steps 1-5).

- **Part A: Testing in ABN** - Steps 1-5 in ABN environment
- **Part B: Production Deployment** - Steps 1-5 in PROD environment

---

## Part A: Testing in ABN Environment

Set `API_MODE=ABN` in your `.env` file before starting.

## Step 1: Transform XML Files to JSON

Transform XML files into I14Y-compliant JSON format. This automatically creates both concept definitions and code lists.

### Via Command Line:
```bash
# Process files and create new concept versions (existing concepts)
python AD_I14Y_transformator.py PGR SNE ./AD_VS/XML ./AD_VS/Transformed 2026-06-01 2.0.3

# Create completely new concepts (with -n flag)
python AD_I14Y_transformator.py PGR SNE ./AD_VS/XML ./AD_VS/Transformed 2026-06-01 1.0.0 -n
```

### Parameters:
- `responsible_key`: Responsible person (PGR, SNE)
- `deputy_key`: Deputy person (PGR, SNE)  
- `input_folder`: Path to XML files
- `output_folder`: Path for JSON output
- `valid_from_date`: Validity start date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `version`: Version number (e.g., 2.0.3)
- `-n`: Optional flag to create new concepts (if omitted, creates new versions of existing concepts)

### Version Management:
**Important:** Always increment the version number when updating existing concepts!

1. **For new concepts** (with `-n` flag): Start with `1.0.0`
2. **For existing concepts**: 
   - Get current version from I14Y API
   - Increment appropriately:
     - Major changes: `2.0.0` → `3.0.0`
     - Minor updates: `2.0.0` → `2.1.0`
     - Patches: `2.0.0` → `2.0.1`

**GUI automatically fetches the current version from I14Y** when you select XML files, making version management easier.

### Output:
- **Concepts**: `AD_VS/Transformed/Concepts/` - Concept definition files
- **Codelists**: `AD_VS/Transformed/Codelists/` - Code list entry files

## Step 2: Upload Concept Versions (ABN)

Upload the transformed concept definitions to I14Y **ABN environment**.

```bash
# Upload single concept
python I14Y_API_handling.py -pc AD_VS/Transformed/Concepts/concept-file.json

# Upload multiple concepts from directory
python I14Y_API_handling.py -pmc AD_VS/Transformed/Concepts/
```

## Step 3: Upload Code Lists (ABN)

Upload code list entries to the previously created concepts in **ABN environment**.

```bash
# Upload single codelist
python I14Y_API_handling.py -pcl AD_VS/Transformed/Codelists/codelist-file.json <concept-identifier>

# Upload multiple codelists from directory
python I14Y_API_handling.py -pmcl AD_VS/Transformed/Codelists/
```

## Step 4: Set Registration Status to "Recorded" (ABN)

Update concept status to make them officially recorded in **ABN environment**.

```bash
# Set single concept to recorded status
python I14Y_API_handling.py -srs Recorded <concept-identifier>

# Note: For batch operations, you'll need to script individual -srs calls
# as there is no batch method for setting registration status
```

**Important:** When you set the publication level or registration status via API, these changes are submitted as **proposals**. A **data steward** must review and approve these proposals on the I14Y platform before they become active.

### Data Steward Approval Process:
1. After setting status/publication level via API, the proposal is created
2. A data steward logs into the I14Y platform
3. The steward reviews the proposal in the I14Y management interface
4. The steward can either:
   - ✅ **Accept** the proposal - Status/publication level becomes active
   - ❌ **Reject** the proposal - Status/publication level remains unchanged

## Step 5: Manual Verification via I14Y GUI (ABN)

1. **Login to I14Y Platform:**
   - **ABN Environment**: https://www.i14y-a.admin.ch

2. **Navigate to Your Concepts:**
   - Go to "My Concepts" or search for your uploaded concepts
   - Verify concept status shows as "Recorded" (after data steward approval)
   - Check concept content and code list entries
   - Confirm multilingual content is displayed correctly

3. **Data Steward Actions (if you have steward permissions):**
   - Review pending proposals for publication level changes
   - Review pending proposals for registration status changes
   - Accept or reject proposals as appropriate
   - Note: Only approved proposals will be reflected in the concept's active status

4. **Verification Checklist:**
   - ✅ Concept status = "Recorded" (approved by data steward)
   - ✅ Publication level is set correctly (approved by data steward)
   - ✅ Code list entries are present
   - ✅ Multilingual names display correctly
   - ✅ Metadata (responsible persons, validity dates) is accurate

---

## Part B: Production Deployment

**Once ABN testing is complete and all concepts are verified:**

### Step 6: Deploy to PROD Environment

1. **Update Configuration:**
   - Change `.env` file: `API_MODE=PROD`
   - Restart backend if running

2. **Repeat Steps 1-5 in PROD:**
   - Step 1: Transform XML files (if needed, or reuse ABN transformations)
   - Step 2: Upload concepts to PROD
   - Step 3: Upload code lists to PROD
   - Step 4: Set registration status in PROD
   - Step 5: Verify in PROD I14Y platform: https://www.i14y.admin.ch

3. **Final Verification:**
   - Verify all concepts are correctly deployed in PROD
   - Ensure data steward has approved proposals in PROD
   - Confirm public accessibility if publication level is "Public"

# 📝 Important Notes

## Version Management:
**CRITICAL: Always use proper version numbers!**

### Version Numbering Rules:
- Use semantic versioning: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., `2.0.3`)
- **New concepts**: Start with `1.0.0`
- **Updating existing concepts**: Always increment the version
  - **Major changes** (breaking changes): `2.0.0` → `3.0.0`
  - **Minor changes** (new features): `2.0.0` → `2.1.0`
  - **Patch** (bug fixes, small updates): `2.0.0` → `2.0.1`

### How Versioning Works:
1. **GUI (Recommended)**: 
   - Select XML files → System automatically fetches current version from I14Y API
   - You see the current version and must increment it manually
   - If concept doesn't exist or API fails: defaults to `1.0.0`

2. **Command Line**:
   - Manually check current version: `python I14Y_API_handling.py -gci <OID>`
   - Provide the new version as 6th parameter
   - Example: `python AD_I14Y_transformator.py PGR SNE ./AD_VS/XML ./AD_VS/Transformed 2026-06-01 2.0.3`

### Important:
- **Never reuse version numbers** - each upload must have a unique version
- **No hardcoded defaults** - Version is always fetched from API or set to `1.0.0`
- **Backend must be running** for automatic version fetching in GUI

## Transformation Notes:
- Processes files matching `VS_<name>_(...)` or `VS <name>_(...)`
- Automatically generates both concept and codelist JSON files
- Output files include I14Y identifiers in filenames
- Supports multilingual content (DE, EN, FR, IT, RM)

## API Notes:
- OAuth2 authentication with automatic token refresh
- Error logging to `api_errors_log.txt`
- Supports both ABN (test) and PROD environments
- Rate limiting and retry logic included

## Workflow Notes:
- **Step 1** must be completed before Steps 2-3
- **Step 2** (concept upload) must succeed before Step 3 (codelist upload)
- **Step 4** can only be performed after successful upload
- **Step 5** provides final verification and is mandatory for production
- The `-n` flag in Step 1 creates completely new concepts; without it, new versions of existing concepts are created

## Limitations:
- Locked concepts can only be deleted via I14Y official support
- Manual GUI verification is required for final approval
- Some operations may require elevated privileges in production environment

# 🆘 Troubleshooting

## Common Issues:
1. **Authentication failures**: Check `.env` credentials and ensure API_MODE is set correctly (PROD or ABN)
2. **Concept not found**: Ensure Step 2 completed successfully before Step 3
3. **Permission denied**: Verify API permissions for your environment
4. **Status update failed**: Check if concept is in correct state for status change
5. **Flask import errors**: Ensure Flask and Flask-Cors are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
6. **Wrong environment**: Check `.env` file - ensure API_MODE is uncommented for desired environment (PROD or ABN)

## Support:
- Check `api_errors_log.txt` for detailed error information
- Verify environment configuration in `.env`
- Ensure proper sequence of workflow steps

## Todo's:
- Handle versioning in transormation for multiple files
- Clarify why classcode concept with new version can't be uploaded
- Show errors more clear & structured
